Hello there! I'm a data scientist with a Master's in Statistics and Data Science from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where I worked in [Yuval Benjamini's lab](https://sites.google.com/view/yuvalbenjamini/home?authuser=0) on imputation methods for ECG data. My interests include multimodal modeling and representation learning.

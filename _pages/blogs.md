## Feature Selection for the Lazy Data Scientist — Writer's Perspective

In this post, I set out to demystify feature selection for fellow data scientists who, like me, have faced the curse of dimensionality. My goal was to provide a practical, approachable guide to filter-based feature selection methods, complete with code and real-world examples. I wanted to clarify the differences between filter, wrapper, and embedded methods, and to show why filter methods are often the best starting point for large, noisy datasets.

I walked through univariate and multivariate filter techniques, mutual information, and Relief-based methods, sharing not just the theory but also hands-on Python code. I emphasized the importance of combining multiple methods for a more robust feature set, and discussed how to evaluate feature selectors using diversity, stability, and performance metrics. Ultimately, my hope was to empower readers to make smarter, more explainable choices in their machine learning projects—without getting lost in the weeds.

**The Israeli Antitrust Authority** - *Research Analyst and Economist (2018 - 2020)*

As a researcher in the IAA's research department I took part in several projects.

*   The Law for Competition Enhancement in the Food Segment - In 2014 the IAA passed a law that forbids food manufacturers from paying retailers in return for placing their products in better locations on the shelf (these payments usually called *vendor allowances*). There were claims that this practice allows large manufacturers to squeeze smaller ones out of the shelf (and thus from the market).
    In this regard, I participated in all the stages in the process of the research, starting from cleaning the dataset, analyze it and lastly construct the statistical model to measure the causal effect.
    The research was later covered on the news, see [Calcalist](https://www.calcalist.co.il/marketing/articles/0,7340,L-3792190,00.html) and [Globes](https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001318093).

*   Geographic Concentration in Banking Industry - Played a central role in the research design in order to quantify the market power of banks in areas with weak competition.

*   Various market analysis and statistical consulting for the IAA economist.

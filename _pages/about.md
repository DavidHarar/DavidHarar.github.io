# About Me

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Master's degree in Statistics and Data Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. My interests include statistics,  economics, and programming. I previously worked as a research analyst in the Israeli Antithrust Authority where I focused mainly on competition in the food industry. Today I work at a private research center, also focusing on competition.
I also hold a Master's degree in Economics, also from the Hebrew University.

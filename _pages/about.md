Iâ€™m currently pursuing a master's degree in Statistics and Data Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. My interests include statistics,  machine learning and their implementation in computer vision. 
I also hold a master's degree in Economics from the Hebrew University and I previously worked at the Israeli Antithrust Authority as a research analyst.

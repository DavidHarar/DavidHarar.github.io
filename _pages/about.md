Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Master's degree in Statistics and Data Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. My interests include statistics,  economics, and programming. I previously worked as a research analyst in the Israeli Antithrust Authority where I focused mainly on competition in the food industry.
I also hold a Master's degree in Economics, also from the Hebrew University.
